In this project, we designed a pedestrian detection and warning system to be deployed at an experimental road intersection at Berkeley, California. The system makes use of start-of-the-art intelligent transportation technologies, including thermal imaging traffic sensors, computing algorithms, and signage systems. The technology based IDS approach addresses pedestrian safety.

The final report addresses three main problems:
- Sensing System Design Problem
- IDS Timing Algorithm Design Problem
- Warning Sign (WS) Design Problem
